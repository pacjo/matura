nie ja oceniałem, ogólnie można tutaj trochę poprawić, ale wymagania maturalne spełnia

With the modern world becoming more and more automated we’re becoming less physically active with each passing year. Recently a glimpse of hope appeared on the horizon. Based on the technology that powered the remote work during pandemic – online meetings, remote fitness classes are looking to help us get into shape once again. Here I’m looking to share my view on this new trend and show how will it change our lives.

Just like the remote work during the 2020 pandemic made us aware of the disadvantages of commuting, online fitness classes aim to do the same here. They offer a much higher convenience by allowing anyone to join the classes from anywhere. Most are already available on phones and PCs and even some smart TV systems. With no gym to commute to and no cloths to carry the convenience factor has never been higher.

One thing that stops most of our plans is motivation, or lack thereof. This issue is also solved by remote classes. With most services offering prerecorded exercises, there’s no specific time you have to allocate for your own health. Simply join whenever you want to and start exercising right away. When you’re tired just close the app and you will be able to continue when you’re ready again. No need to wait for break or miss exercises while others continue.

With most technology aiming to free us from physical work, remote fitness classes try to restore the balance in our lives. Being in every way better then their traditional counterparts, I hope this technology is here to stay and help us keep in shape in our automated world.
